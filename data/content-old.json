    "title": "Answers to your questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How does solar energy work?",
        "answer": "Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity through photovoltaic cells. When sunlight hits the panels, it creates an electric field that generates direct current (DC) electricity. An inverter then converts this DC power into alternating current (AC) electricity that powers your home. Any excess energy can be stored in batteries or sent back to the grid."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long do solar panels last?",
        "answer": "Quality solar panels typically last 25-30 years or more. Most manufacturers offer warranties of 25 years, guaranteeing at least 80% efficiency after that period. With proper maintenance, many panels continue producing electricity well beyond their warranty period, making them an excellent long-term investment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much will a solar installation cost?",
        "answer": "Solar installation costs vary based on system size, location, and specific requirements. On average, residential systems range from $15,000 to $25,000 before incentives. However, federal tax credits, state rebates, and financing options can significantly reduce upfront costs. We offer free consultations to provide accurate quotes tailored to your needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will solar panels work on cloudy or rainy days?",
        "answer": "Yes! Solar panels still generate electricity on cloudy days, though at reduced efficiency (typically 10-25% of peak output). Modern panels are designed to capture diffuse light, not just direct sunlight. Over the year, most systems produce enough energy to offset your electricity needs, accounting for seasonal variations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the benefits of solar energy?",
        "answer": "Solar energy offers numerous benefits: significant reduction in electricity bills, increased property value, energy independence, environmental sustainability, and protection against rising utility costs. Additionally, many regions offer tax incentives and rebates that make solar more affordable than ever."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can solar panels work at night or during winter?",
        "answer": "Solar panels don't generate electricity at night, but battery storage systems can store excess daytime energy for nighttime use. During winter, panels still work effectively—they actually perform better in cold temperatures. While shorter days mean less production, annual output typically meets energy needs when systems are properly sized."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need planning permission for solar panels?",
        "answer": "In most cases, residential solar installations are considered permitted development and don't require planning permission. However, restrictions may apply for listed buildings, conservation areas, or flats. We'll help you check local regulations and handle any necessary paperwork as part of our service."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much maintenance do solar panels require?",
        "answer": "Solar panels require minimal maintenance. Regular cleaning (2-4 times per year) and annual professional inspections are usually sufficient. Most systems come with monitoring capabilities that alert you to any performance issues. We offer comprehensive maintenance packages to keep your system running at peak efficiency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I expand my solar system later?",
        "answer": "Yes, most solar systems can be expanded if you have available roof space and your electrical system can handle the additional capacity. We design systems with future expansion in mind and can help you add more panels as your energy needs grow or budget allows."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I move house?",
        "answer": "Solar panels typically increase property value by 3-4%, making your home more attractive to buyers. If you're moving, you can either leave the system (which adds value) or potentially transfer it to your new home, depending on the installation type and local regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there financing options available?",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer various financing options including solar loans, leasing programs, and power purchase agreements (PPAs). Many customers choose $0-down solar loans that allow you to start saving immediately while paying for the system with the energy savings it generates."
